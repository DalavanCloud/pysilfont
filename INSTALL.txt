********* NOTE ********** We are experiencing issues with upgrades to existing installations and with uninstalling, so these notes are under review...

On OSX or Ubuntu
================

To install the module and the scripts run:

  python setup.py install --user --record installed-files.txt
or
  sudo python setup.py install --record installed-files.txt
  
setup.py uses setuptools, so if not already installed, you can install with "sudo apt-get install python-setuptools"

For OSX users, see also scripts/tools/actionsosx/README.txt

Upgrading
---------

Prior to running the install as above, clean up from previous installations using

  python setup.py clean --all

(If you get them, ignore warning message about some modules requiring certain packages)

Uninstalling
------------

To uninstall the module run:

  sudo -H pip uninstall pysilfont

This gives an error about an egg file missing, but does do at least some uninstalling!

(If you don't have pip installed, you can install with "sudo apt install python-pip") 

To get rid of all the files installed : (careful with rm)

  cat installed-files.txt | xargs sudo rm --verbose -vr
