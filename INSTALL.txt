On OSX or Ubuntu
================

To install the module and the scripts run:

  sudo python setup.py install --record installed-files.txt

setup.py uses setuptools, so if not already installed, you can install with "sudo apt-get install python-setuptools"

For OSX users, see also scripts/tools/actionsosx/README.txt

Uninstalling
------------

To uninstall the module run:

  sudo -H pip uninstall pysilfont

(If you don't have pip installed, you can install with "sudo apt install python-pip") 

To get rid of all the files installed : (careful with rm)

  cat installed-files.txt | xargs sudo rm --verbose -vr
